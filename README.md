Getting a Jekyll template up and running
========

A beginner’s project!  I am using the [mediator theme](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/mediator/)

Basic Command Line Commands
-------
* `cd` = change directory (example: `cd Documents/Workspace/`)
* `pwd` = present working directory
* `ls` = list items in directory
* `..` = parent directory
* `*` = everything (excludes dot files (like `.gitignore`) which are hidden and need to be added separately)

* pressing tab-tab will preview the available directories


Basic Git Commands
-------

* `git status` = current status (green and red means something is in the works - only make changes when in “clean” state”)
* `git add` = stage a file for commit
* `git commit` = commit version in preparation of push to GitHub.  Can revert to this version if needed in the future
* `git push` = push all of the commits to github.com.
* `git diff` = shows the differences between your previous and current versions, before committing


Basic Vim functions
-------

* Press `i` to enter Insert mode (can begin entering text)
* Press “ESC” to exit Insert mode
* `:w` = SAVE
* `:q` = QUIT
* `:wq` = SAVE and quit
